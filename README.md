# MSc Thesis Code – C-V2X QoS Prediction

This repository contains the source code and dataset used in my MSc thesis:  
**“Enhancing Machine Learning-Based QoS Prediction for C-V2X Networks”**  
at Munster Technological University, Cork.

---

## Project Summary  
The project explores how machine learning models can be used to predict Quality of Service (QoS) metrics — such as:
- **Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)**
- **Network Delay**
- **Throughput**

in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication networks.

## Contents  
- Jupyter notebooks for training and testing models:  
  - Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost  
  - Hybrid models combining predictions  
- Dataset: `dataset.csv`

---

## Models Implemented  
**Classification**
- PDR using Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost

**Regression**
- Delay and Throughput using all above + hybrid models

---

## Metrics Used  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 (for classification)  
- RMSE, MAE, R² (for regression)

---

## Thesis Link  
A full explanation of methodology, results, and analysis is available in the MSc thesis.
