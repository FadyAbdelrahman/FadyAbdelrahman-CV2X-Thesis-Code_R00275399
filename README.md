MSc Thesis Code – C-V2X QoS Prediction
This repository contains the source code and dataset used in my MSc thesis:
“Enhancing Machine Learning-Based QoS Prediction for C-V2X Networks”
at Munster Technological University, Cork.

Project Summary
The project explores how machine learning models can be used to predict Quality of Service (QoS) metrics—such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Network Delay, and Throughput—in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication networks.

1) Contents
Jupyter notebooks for training and testing models:
    -Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
    -Hybrid models combining predictions

Preprocessed dataset: dataset.csv

2) Models Implemented
    -Classification:
      -PDR using Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost

    -Regression:
      -Delay and Throughput using all above + hybrid models

3) Metrics Used
    -Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 (for classification)
    -RMSE, MAE, R² (for regression)

4) Thesis Link
A full explanation of methodology, results, and analysis is available in the MSc thesis.
